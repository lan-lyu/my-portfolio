            <p>Hi! My name is Lan Lyu(吕蓝), which came from the combination of my parents' last names. 
                "Lyu(吕)" is the last name of my father, 
                and "Lan(蓝)" is the last name of my mother.</p>
            <p>Pityfully I never had a cat though I've been always thinking about it. 
                So here is just my story. 
                If one day a cat walks into my life, I will definitely came back to share with you!</p>
            <br>
            <h3>My Childhood</h3>
            <p>I was born in a small town called "Linan(临安)" in Zhejiang Province, China, where I spent my whole childhood.</p>
            <p>My parents always hope me to be an independent girl. 
                When I was 23 months old, they sent me to kindergarden, and the children there were mostly over 3.
                On my first day in primary school, my parents asked me to walk home alone when classes ended, when I was only 6 years old.  </p> 
            <p>Therefore, I was raised up without so many restrictions and have made most choices on my own.
                For example, I insist not going to any after-school class, and learning Guzheng, Taekwondo, and Chinese folk dance. 
                My parents respected my choice. </p>

            <br>
            <h3>My Junior School and My High School </h3>
            <p>I went to Hangzhou, the capital of Zhejiang Province, to attend junior high school and started to board at school.
                I still miss the three years spent there. Teachers treated us like friends and friends were like my families, I felt like the school is my other family.
                In order to have fun at home on the weekend, I would complete most homework on Friday, which had really exercised my time planning ability.</p> 
            <p> I did not take the high school entrance examinations. I was admitted to the best high school in Hangzhou- Hangzhou No.2 High School (杭州二中) directly.
                There are so many memories that I find it hard to pick the most important ones. 
                I met so many excellent friends and teachers at that time, some of whom became my best friends, my life-long mentors, my most unforgettable memories. 
                Their existences shape who I am today. </p>

            <br>
            <h3>My University </h3>
            <p>Now I'm learning Computer Science in Peking University of China.
                There are so many excellent schoolmates there and I learned a lot from them. Talking with them is a treat,
                The University provided a brand-new platform, and stimulated me to reach a higher standard. I appreciate it from the bottom of my heart.</p>
